                Welcome  to my Hobby official web site! In my Hobby website, you can take a look at certain links I have uploaded along with sommw images that
                were also placed in my website. I hope  you find it useful to your own needs. You can follow my link at <a href="Hobby_2.html">Hobbies.</a>
                You will also find it on my navigation bar. Other than that let's explore!.

                <br>
                It's not all about how powerful a gaming console is. Sometimes, it's more about how the console takes advantage of the available hardware. Sony has managed to put all the PS5's hardware to good use with features like haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, insane storage speeds for instantaneous load times, and VR support.
            <br>
            Besides the visual improvements you'd typically expect from a new console, these added features ensure you get a truly next-generation experience when playing the latest games.
            <br>
            Most of us can agree that Sony has consistently put out high-quality games for the PS4. For instance, God of War bagged the prestigious Game of the Year award in 2018, and The Last of Us Part II did the same in 2020. 
            You can realistically expect this level of quality to continue with the PS5 as well.
