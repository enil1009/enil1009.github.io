                    his way to learning how to code. One of my favorite hobbies is to play video games. It is truly one of the things I am completely passionate about.
                    On my free time I just get up and turn on my PS5 console. One of the games I love playing a lot is called Dark Souls.
                    I sometimes play on Warzone with my buddys as well. It is one of the main reasons I play is that whatever time I spend
                    on the games is when I get to spend time with good friends. But Playstation 5 is not only about gaming. You can also watch your favorite streaming apps on it,
                    such as Youtube, Disney +, etc! You  can also listen to music  on Spotify!

                    How to actually use a PS5 to have fun?
                    Simply put, all you have to is buy a PS5 console(Whenever it is available, that is). Each console comes with one Dualshock 5 controller,
                    controller USB-C charger, power adapter, and one HDMI 2.0 cable. First you want to unkbox your controller and check for any damages.
                    Then you want to unbox the console next and inspect for further damages. Once you're done with the inspection you want to connect the 
                    power adapter found on the back of the console. Next you want to connect the hdmi cable to the console(also found on the back of the console.).
                    Once you have done the following, you must connect either the ethernet cable to the back of the console for more reliable internet to 
                    the player experience and if your console is far away from your modem then you're ready to power on your PS5 console and it will start
                    to greet you. Following the greeting, you will be prompted to initialize your set up(this includes your first and last name, email address, and
                    your Playstation Network Profile.). Once that is done you will also be prompted to put in your wifi  SSID and password. Now that your
                    connection has been established, you can now insert your gaming disc and start the insatllation of the game. Once you're
                    done with installing the game, you're good  to go on your amazing journey of playing! Also, PS5 is not exclusive to gaming, you can download
                    music, images, or even your favorite streaming service and just add in your accounts!
